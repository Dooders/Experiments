"""Action management module for agent behaviors in a multi-agent environment.

This module defines the core Action class and implements various agent behaviors
including movement, resource gathering, sharing, and combat. Each action has
associated costs, rewards, and conditions for execution.

Key Components:
    - Action: Base class for defining executable agent behaviors
    - Movement: Deep Q-Learning based movement with rewards
    - Gathering: Resource collection from environment nodes
    - Sharing: Resource distribution between nearby agents
    - Combat: Competitive resource acquisition through attacks

Technical Details:
    - Range-based interactions (gathering: config-based, sharing: 30 units, attack: 20 units)
    - Resource-based action costs and rewards
    - Numpy-based distance calculations
    - Automatic tensor-numpy conversion for state handling
"""


class Action:
    """Base class for defining executable agent behaviors.

    Encapsulates a named action with an associated weight for action selection
    and an execution function that defines the behavior.

    Args:
        name (str): Identifier for the action (e.g., "move", "gather")
        weight (float): Selection probability weight for action choice
        function (callable): Function implementing the action behavior
            Must accept agent as first parameter and support *args, **kwargs

    Example:
        ```python
        move = Action("move", 0.4, move_action)
        move.execute(agent, additional_arg=value)
        ```
